# Java Architecture

Based on four distinct technologies, each of which is defined by a separate specification:
- the Java programming language;
- the Java class file format;
- the Java API;
- the JVM.

Source code written in `.java` is compiled into Java `.class` files with Java Compiler (compile-time environment) and then these `.class` files are run on a Java Virtual Machine (run-time environment).

Java API  is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK). It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors. As program runs,, it fullfils program's Java API calls by invoking methods in class files that implement the Java API.
