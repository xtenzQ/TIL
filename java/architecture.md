# Java Architecture

Based on four distinct technologies, each of which is defined by a separate specification:
- the Java programming language;
- the Java class file format;
- the Java API;
- the JVM.

Source code written in `.java` is compiled into Java `.class` files with Java Compiler (compile-time environment) and then these `.class` files are run on a Java Virtual Machine (run-time environment).

Java API is set of runtime libraries that give you a standard way to access the system resources of a host computer.
